# Guess-the-Number

This is a simple number guessing game. The program randomly selects a whole number from 1 to 100 and prompts the user to make an initial guess. The program then tells the user whether the guess is too high or too low and prompts the user for another guess. This continues until the user guesses the number correctly. The program reports the number of guesses it took the user to get the number.
